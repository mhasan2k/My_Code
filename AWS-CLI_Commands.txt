# Create a S3 Bucket
aws s3 mb s3://bucket-name
aws s3 ls       #List Your Buckets

# The following command lists all objects and folders in a bucket.
aws s3 ls s3://bucket-name
aws s3 ls s3://bucket-name/path/

# Delete a Bucket
aws s3 rb s3://bucket-name

# The following example deletes all objects and subfolders in the bucket and then removes the bucket.
aws s3 rb s3://bucket-name --force

# copy file from loacl to S3
aws s3 cp file.txt s3://my-bucket/

// Delete local file
$ rm ./MyFile1.txt

// Attempt sync without --delete option - nothing happens
$ aws s3 sync . s3://my-bucket/path

// Sync with deletion - object is deleted from bucket
$ aws s3 sync . s3://my-bucket/path --delete
delete: s3://my-bucket/path/MyFile1.txt

// Delete object from bucket
$ aws s3 rm s3://my-bucket/path/MySubdirectory/MyFile3.txt

$ aws s3 sync . s3://my-bucket/path --storage-class STANDARD_IA



Local directory contains 3 files:
MyFile1.txt
MyFile2.rtf
MyFile88.txt
'''
$ aws s3 sync . s3://my-bucket/path --exclude "*.txt"
upload: MyFile2.rtf to s3://my-bucket/path/MyFile2.rtf

Assume local directory and s3://my-bucket/path currently in sync and each contains 3 files:
MyFile1.txt
MyFile2.rtf
MyFile88.txt
'''
// Delete local .txt files
$ rm *.txt

// Sync with delete, excluding files that match a pattern. MyFile88.txt is deleted, while remote MyFile1.txt is not.

delete: s3://my-bucket/path/MyFile88.txt
'''
// Delete MyFile2.rtf
$ aws s3 rm s3://my-bucket/path/MyFile2.rtf

// Sync with delete, excluding MyFile2.rtf - local file is NOT deleted
$ aws s3 sync s3://my-bucket/path . --delete --exclude "./MyFile2.rtf"
download: s3://my-bucket/path/MyFile1.txt to MyFile1.txt
'''
// Sync with delete, local copy of MyFile2.rtf is deleted
$ aws s3 sync s3://my-bucket/path . --delete
delete: MyFile2.rtf

// Copy MyFile.txt in current directory to s3://my-bucket/path
$ aws s3 cp MyFile.txt s3://my-bucket/path/
